# Root-Axial-Cuts
While in recent years, new tools for characterization of root anatomical features have been developed, they are demand intensive labor and time consuming and therefore cannot be considered as high-throughput. To address the high-throughput phenotyping limitation, we suggest to build a deep learning system that could extract both axial and radial conductance from ~ 500 cross-section images,
